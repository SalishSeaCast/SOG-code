!5.8D-07 (Fasham 0.05 day^-1)
!5.7D-05 (Fasham 5 m/day).  try 50 m/day

!!!!the velocity I'm using is quite high.  Should be between 7 and 18 m/day (or 8D-5 to 2D-04) 
(consistent with estimates from Dune et al. (1997) and Bacon et al. (1996) of 2 to 20 m per day.
!based on remineralization length scale (Denman and Pena)
!
Remineralization length scale is velocity/remineralization which is useful for $\Db$ at depth where there is no source.  From drifting traps at depth, Denman and Pena find in Feb, May, and August, 100, 210, and 260m respectively.  Fasham uses a $re = 0.05$ per day for remineralization of  fecal pellets which is half of Denman and Doney (1996) $0.1$ per day who include dissolved and non-sinking particulates.  I use $0.07$ per day for $\Db$ and $0.3$ per day for non-sinking. Thus for sinking rate I have between 7 m per day and 18 m per day according to the remineralization length scale.   Greater than half the organic material should not sink, according to Clegg and Whitfield, 1990 and Charette et al (Denman and Pena,)
!try 0.035 per day for particulates ==> velocities of 3.5 m per day to 9 m per day  (1.D-04)
!try 0.17 per day for suspended
